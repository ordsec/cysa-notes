- The loop
	- **Planning & requirements**
		- Why are we doing it this? What is our goal?
		- Business-oriented - we don't need to gather info that doesn't concern our org
		- What are legal regulations/restrictions?
		- Sometimes this entire cycle is mandatory - by law
		- High-level: what are some of the most likely threats for our org?
	- **Collection & processing**
		- We need some raw information, something to work with
		- Needs to be done in an organized manner
		- Consistent
		- Automated as much as possible - not manual, otherwise it takes all the time in the world
			- SIEM comes into play here
		- Choose good sources - real devices, real endpoints
		- Processing and normalizing
			- Normalization: the act of making disparate data look the same
	- **Analysis**
		- The more data, the higher our chance to get something useful out of it
		- But it also can be too much
			- Automation will help us out
			- Scripts (Bash, Python, PowerShell, etc)
			- SIEM - event correlation and automation
			- Some tools involve ML for filtering out the noise
	- **Dissemination**
		- Communicating our findings after the analysis
			- This is done internally
		- Choose audience correctly - who are the interested parties?
			- Different levels
			- Technical staff - those who configure our security devices and respond to incidents
			- Upper management
			- C suite if something threatens the entire business
		- Make sure everybody understands
			- Tech speak with technical audiences
			- Make it clear for non-technical personnel
			- Your audiences may have different objectives and priorities in mind
		- Types of derived intelligence:
			- **Strategic**
				- Long-term objectives and priorities
			- **Operational**
				- Day-to-day priorities
			- **Tactical**
				- Real-time, shortest-term objectives, things we can do *right now*, probably falls under IR procedures
		- External communication? 
			- Helping out another org is possible
			- OPSEC comes first - don't talk about vulns you've found!
	- **Feedback**
		- We have to continuously improve our intelligence process
		- Feeding information back into the TI cycle
		- Lessons learned - what went right? Wrong? Learn from both
		- Did we discover anything new? Any new threats/risks that appeared in the meantime?
		- Come up with a clear list of tasks and a list of people who will be responsible
		- Who wasn't doing what they were supposed to? 
			- Avoid blaming people - encourage improvement kindly, stay constructive, we can all do better
