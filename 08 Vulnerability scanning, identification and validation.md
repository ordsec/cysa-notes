- Two major aspects here:
	- What do we scan?
	- How do we do it?
- **Scan workflow**:
	- Define the scope
	- Gather asset data
	- Arrange everything with the leadership so you don't blow up normal business operations
	- Conduct the scan
	- Analyze the results
	- Confirm vulnerabilities (depending on scanning tool accuracy)
	- Remediate
	- Verify remediation
	- Report
	- Re-scan regularly

## What to scan?

- Depending on the size of an org, there can be hundreds, thousands, even 10s of thousands of devices
- We can't realistically scan all of them! We won't be able to do much else. We need a priority system.

### Asset criticality

- How important is an asset? What is critical to business operation?
	- Think about the impact of having this asset affected in any malicious way. Is it really bad? Then the asset is important and it goes high on the priority list.
	- Not everything is critical though. If someone steals the espresso machine from your recreation area, it doesn't affect business operations in such a meaningful way (though it'll certainly ruin the day for many). A shame, but not critical.
- Here's a rough priority system that can be used as a starting point
	1. **People**. As far as CompTIA (and anyone with half a brain) is concerned, people's lives come first in any scenario. This includes your employees, partners, suppliers, even visitors.
	2. **Tangible assets**. Servers and whatnot.
	3. **Intangible assets**. Product ideas, development plans, brand, reputation.

### Asset and inventory tracking

- This is no easy task, but it can be done with the help of dedicated tools
- Things to track for devices: type, model, SN, internal ID, location, user, value, service information (for vendor/repair)
	- Classification: grouping of devices/assets using certain characteristics
		- Usage, e.g. development/test/production environments
		- Network: what network/subnet/segment a device belongs to
		- Sensitivity (how sensitive the info contained on a device is): public, private, restricted, confidential, etc.
		- Outside connections: does a device communicate with external entities such as partners? Does it store PII?
		- Financial value. More expensive tech gets higher priority too.
		- Legal requirements: what's mandatory to have up and running?
		- Contractual obligations

## Vulnerability scanning

Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanner (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys)
- Not `nmap`!
- A piece of software that scans hosts, network devices, endpoints, servers, etc.
- Looks for vulns in the following aspects:
	- OS version and patches
	- Services
	- Configuration
	- Network shares that may be accessible
	- User accounts
	- Weak security policies

### Scoping

- The **scope** describes the extent of the scan
- What systems and networks are included? 
	- Can go by department
- What technical measures will be used to test whether systems are present on the network?
- What tests will be performed against systems discovered by the scanner?
- Know all this before you commence the scan
- Compliance might have to be considered
	- If you process credit cards, you have to be PCI DSS compliant
	- Make sure all systems involved in credit card processing are within the scope of the required scan

### Methodology, techniques, considerations

- **Mapping and enumeration**
	- Inventory devices, services, versions, plugins, etc
	- `nmap` is used internally at this stage by many scanners
- **Passive scanning**
	- Look for public info
	- Capture network traffic
	- **Don't get involved in any way**
	- Don't interact with the target
	- Zero impact on network and services
	- Mostly cannot be detected
- **Active scanning**
	- Directly interact with the target, make a connection, hit it with some traffic
	- Actively send requests and analyze answers
	- It's visible and it's noisy
	- Can create performance issues and downtime, stuff can crash
	- **Do it outside the working hours!**
	- Noisy, easily detected
- **Credentialed scanning**
	- Receive a valid user/admin account for the purposes of vuln scanning, log into certain hosts, perform automated checks
		- Such accounts must be secured, their use limited to specific days/hours/location
	- Very in-depth due to the insider point of view - no need to scan every port to figure out what services are running, no trial and error
	- Highest level of detail
	- Similar to a situation an insider threat is in
- **Non-credentialed scanning**
	- No user account provided
	- Probing/testing hosts and networks to gather info
	- Outside hacker's point of view
	- **Exam**: remember that this always uses more bandwidth
	- Scanning software has to go through a lot more trial and error, sometimes even brute forcing
	- Jeopardizes functionality of machines and services - can crash
	- Not too accurate
- **Server-based scanning**
	- Not all scanning is done from some central location on the network
	- Checking servers for potential vulnerabilities by connecting to them
	- Can be credentialed or non-credentialed
- **Agent-based**
	- An agent is installed on each host
	- Administered from a central console
	- Run scans on hosts
	- Report findings back to the central console
	- Acts like a backdoor for scanning utilities
	- Advantages:
		- Credentialed by default (has to be installed on the host, so it runs as a service)
		- Efficient resource usage - scanning is performed locally, network is only needed to commucate findings
		- Works with offline devices, findings are reported upon next connection
	- Disadvantages:
		- Increased management overhead - must install agents before anything can be done
		- Not necessarily OS-agnostic, especially when it comes to network devices
		- Vulnerable backdoor - opens up an additional possible attack vector. If agent is compromised, you're in trouble
- **Internal**
	- Conducted from within the org's network, aim to identify vulns existing on internal network devices (servers, workstations, appliances, etc.)
	- What could an attacker do if they got into the network?
	- Detecting vulns that could be exploited by insiders
	- Scanning a broad range of devices, including those not directly accessible from the internet
	- Identifying misconfigurations, unnecessary services, insecure internal practices
	- Providing a more complete view of the internal network's security posture
- **External**
	- Conducted from the outside of the org's network, focused on identifying vulns in externally facing assets: web/email servers, firewalls, etc.
	- Concerns everything an external attacker might exploit to breach the perimeter and gain access to the internal network
	- Simulating the perspective of an outside attacker, with appropriate visibility
	- Prioritizing assets that are the most at-risk (public-facing web apps, remote access services)
- **Sensitivity levels**
	- Pay careful attention to these
	- Sensitivity levels are determined by settings - what types of checks the scanner will perform, should it be customized to ensure the scan meets its objectives?
	- Consider false positives (don't want too many) and system disruption
	- Start with a template, adjust based on the scope
	- Templates may be custom-developed
	- Efficiency can be improved via plug-ins - a lot of scanners are extensible
- **Data types**
	- Scanning heavily relies on various types of data to effectively identify and assess potential vulns
	- Asset inventory data - see above (asset criticality, inventory tracking); basically you must know what exactly you have in order to perform effective scans
	- Configuration data - how each asset in the environment is set up. Misconfigurations lead to vulns - understand the current state of all assets
	- Network data - info about network topology and traffic patterns can help identify network design related vulns
	- User and account data - info about user accounts and their privileges can be useful in identifying vulnerabilities related to excessive or inappropriate access rights
	- Patch level data - know which patches have been applied to each system, and you'll know what systems might be missing critical updates and therefore might be vulnerable
	- Threat intel data - use vuln feeds and threat intel sources to stay up to date on recent vulns and exploits
	- Scan results data - what's produced by the scan itself, typically includes identified vulns, severity scores, remediation action recommendations
	- Historical data - past scan results help track progress over time and identify recurring issues
- **Technical constraints**
	- Some technical challenges that might be encountered in the scanning process - keep these in mind, make sure you prepare for your scans and set things up properly
	- Network limitations
	- Performance impact
	- Limited visibility
	- Encryption challenges
	- Authentication
	- False positives/negatives
	- Interpreting scan results
	- Keeping up with new vulns

### Risks associated with scanning activities

- System performance impact
	- Vuln scanning is a resource-intensive process
	- System performance can be degraded, especially if scans are being run during a busy time
- System instability
	- Operations may be inadvertently disrupted by vuln scanning
	- Especially true for poorly configured systems, legacy systems, or anything with existing bugs
- False positives and false negatives (see [09](https://github.com/ordsec/cysa-notes/blob/master/09%20Vulnerability%20scanning%20results%20%26%20CVSS%20scores.md))
- Sensitive data exposure
	- This data is often involved in scans (for instance, system information, network structures, etc.)
	- The results of the scan have to be properly secured - they are also sensitive data
	- We don't want any of this exposed
- Compliance issues
	- Scans may be performed and documented in a specific way, depending on the regulatory environment
	- If this is not done, compliance issues will ensue

### Regulatory requirements

- Any vuln management program starts with requirements: what to scan and how to scan it?
- These requirements may come from regulatory bodies depending on which environment the org operates in
- Could also be influenced by internal policy-driven requirements
- If you're in the health industry, you have to comply to HIPAA
- FERPA for education
- FISMA for government agencies
- PCI DSS for anything involving credit cards
- Etc. - see [51](https://github.com/ordsec/cysa-notes/blob/master/51%20Security%20policies%20and%20procedures.md) for more
- All these have specific rules and regulations pertaining to vuln scanning

### Segmentation (from the vuln scanning point of view)

- The key term is **reachability**!
- Most networks will have VLANs/subnets/VPN connections
- Scanners have to be able to reach everything in order to work correctly, no matter the method/technique involved
	- For agent-based, agents have to be able to reach the central host
- Proper routing/firewall rules have to be in place prior to scanning
- IDPS has to be adjusted so that it doesn't throw alerts or block authorized scanning
	- **Whitelisting**
	- Same goes for FW
- Consider a dedicated **management network**
	- Separate VLAN or physical network designed specially for managing, controlling, and scanning your infrastructure

### Frequency of vuln scanning

- Depends on risk appetite: the bigger, the less frequently you'll scan
- Severe disruptions can be caused by scanning
- Licensing limitations of scanning software
- What are the time constraints? Scanning can really take a while
- As a rule of thumb, though, scan when...
	- There's some change on the network: additions, updates, etc., whether hardware or software
	- It's required by regulations
	- After a breach. Have a clear understanding of what the vulnerability was that caused it

### Choosing a scanner

- Free vs paid
	- Paid relies on proprietary vuln DBs and threat feeds, which can be better, also proprietary scanning methods
- General-purpose vs specialized (e.g. for web apps or for mobile devices)
- **Nessus**
	- Essential: free, up to 16 hosts
	- Professional: paid, unlimited IPs, best for pentesters
	- Tenable.io: unlimited Nessus scanners, offers RBAC, best for companies of whatever size
	- Lots of scan profiles, can create your own
- **OpenVAS**
	- Free and open-source
	- Developed from the Nessus codebase before Nessus became paid
	- Now part of the Greenbone Security suite
- **Qualys**
	- Infrastructure vuln manager
	- **Cloud-based**!
	- Based on sensors installed all over your network, including cloud
	- Sensors can be deployed as agents or as VMs, passive and out-of-band possible

### Scanner maintenance

- Just like everything else, vuln scanners have to stay up to date
- **Vulnerability feeds** are a crucial part - always keep them current
	- This is usually done automatically, but verifying it manually is never a bad idea

### Exam

This is a very important topic overall! Be able to discuss asset classification, vuln scanners and their aspects: active/passive, credentialed/non-credentialed, agent-based. Remember scanner troubleshooting: reachability is key, also what a management network is. Know scanning tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys; know differences between them and various flavours of Nessus with use cases.

### Server and endpoint vulns

- Missing patches
	- Self-evident - your stuff is not patched to the latest version
	- Remediation: install those patches, silly! In an enterprise setting, have a test environment to make sure you're not breaking anything
	- For mobile devices, MDM solutions take care of pushing out updates. White-listing apps is possible to make sure nothing else runs and to maintain all approved apps
- Unsupported OS's and applications
	- After EOSL, an OS or an app receives no further updates, so you're running the risk of running vulnerable software with no patches available
	- Remediation: upgrade to the latest version - easy to say, hard to do. If it's not possible, isolate or at least segment away all systems that run unsupported stuff
- Buffer overflows - discussed in [19](https://github.com/ordsec/cysa-notes/blob/master/19%20Attack%20mitigation%20-%20buffer%20overflows%2C%20race%20conditions.md)
- Privilege escalation - discussed in [19](https://github.com/ordsec/cysa-notes/blob/master/19%20Attack%20mitigation%20-%20buffer%20overflows%2C%20race%20conditions.md)(Dirty COW) and [23](https://github.com/ordsec/cysa-notes/blob/master/23%20Privilege%20escalation%2C%20MitM.md) (rootkits)
- Arbitrary code execution
	- The attacker attempts to run code of their choice on the target system
	- Worse if that code can run with administrative privileges
	- Usually detected by scans if known
	- Remediation: patching
- Insecure protocol use
	- HTTP instead of HTTPS, FTP instead of SFTP/FTPS, plaintext versions of IMAP, LDAP, etc - they were all designed without security in mind
	- Remediation: find a secure version (a lot of them use TLS), tunnel through IPSec
- Debugging modes
	- App gets developed and deployed, debug mode (used by developers) is not disabled
	- Discloses a lot of info about the app that should be hidden
	- Remediation: only use debug mode in testing, on systems dedicated for that purpose; disable debug mode everywhere else

### Network vulns

- Missing firmware updates
- TLS issues 
	- Outdated TLS version (or using SSL, which is deprecated)
		- Current is 1.2-1.3, disallow anything else
	- Insecure cipher use
		- Some ciphers are vulnerable or too weak, so they shouldn't be used
		- RC2, RC4, DES, IDEA, TDES/3DES, NULL - no good! Disable those
	- Certificate problems
		- Mismatches between the name of the cert and the name of the server - sorta like a fake ID you "borrow" from a friend
		- Cert expiration
		- Unknown CA - captive portals with self-signed certs
		- All these are red flags - users shouldn't proceed further on such sites
- DNS issues
	- DNS has no built-in security, so it's vulnerable to many things
	- BOF, missing patches, RCE can happen here too
	- DNS-specific problems also exist
		- Amplification - attacker sends spoofed DNS requests to a DNS server that are designed to elicit a response that's much larger in size than the original request, the response is sent to the spoofed IP; can cause a DoS condition for the victim (who gets the response) 
- Internal IP disclosure
	- Disclosing the DNS server's private IP on the network
	- Can be in HTTP headers
	- Happens due to poor configuration - server is not aware of NAT in use
- VPN issues
	- Use patched VPN software, make sure ciphers are strong, use the correct IPSec functionality
- Virtualization vulns - virtualization adds more admin overhead, so it should be conducted in a very organized fashion
	- VM escape
	- Management interface access - hypervisor management software should be kept very safe
	- Virtual host patching - see patches and updates, pertains to host OS's and hypervisor software
	- Virtual guest issues - ditto, for guest OS's
	- Virtual network issues - virtual networks should be maintained with the same level of attention to security as physical networks. Use virtual firewalls and isolation to keep everything in check
- IoT vulns: see 40 for SCADA, ICS, PLC's, embedded systems, RTOS, SoC, FPGA, CAN
- Web application vulns - we have to communicate with web devs to prevent these
	- Injection attacks - remediated via proper input validation for the most part
		- SQLi: additional remediation is implementing least privilege on database access and using stored procedures, also WAF
		- XSS - **exam! Know all types**
			- Persistent aka stored: attack code is stored on a server
			- Reflected: attacker tricks user into sending the attack to the server as part of a query string, relies on clicking on a link. The server then sends the attack back tot he user (reflecting it), then malicious code executes
			- DOM-based: occurs within a database maintained by the user's web browser, therefore never seen by the remote web server because it happens on the user's computer entirely
			- Additional remediation: WAF
		- Directory traversal
		- IDOR
		- LFI/RFI
		- CSRF
	- Authentication vulns
		- Password reuse - should be regular against password spraying and credential stuffing
		- Impersonation: attacker tries to misrepresent themselves as a legitimate user, relies on stuff like OAuth open redirects. 
			- Remediation: stronger session handling, refer to [OWASP Session Management Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)
		- MitM
			- Remediation: end-to-end encryption of sessions and network links
		- Session hijacking - taking over an already existing session by acquiring its key or related cookies
			- Remediation: secure all session/cookie data, only transmit it securely

### Improving detection capabilities (thank you GPT!)

Improving detection of threats and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies:

1. **Update and Patch Systems:** Keep all systems, software, and applications updated and patched to the latest version. Many cyber threats exploit known vulnerabilities that have been patched in more recent versions of software.

2. **Use Advanced Security Tools:** Implement advanced security tools that use AI and machine learning to identify and respond to threats. These tools can be more effective in detecting new and sophisticated threats compared to traditional, rule-based systems.

3. **Improve Log Management:** Properly managing and analyzing logs can greatly enhance detection capabilities. Ensure logs are centrally collected, properly formatted, and regularly analyzed.

4. **Integrate Threat Intelligence:** Use threat intelligence feeds to stay updated about the latest threats and vulnerabilities. This can enhance the ability to detect threats that are known in the broader cybersecurity community.

5. **Regular Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regular audits and penetration tests can identify vulnerabilities and gaps in the security posture that can be addressed to improve detection.

6. **Employee Training:** Human error is a significant factor in many security incidents. Regular training can improve the ability of employees to detect phishing attempts, suspicious behavior, and other threats.

7. **Create a Security Culture:** Promoting a culture of security within the organization can help ensure everyone understands the importance of cybersecurity and their role in detecting and preventing threats.

8. **Use of Network Segmentation:** By dividing the network into smaller parts or segments, you reduce the attack surface and can more easily control, detect, and isolate incidents.

9. **Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Solution:** SIEM systems aggregate and analyze data from various sources, providing a centralized view for threat detection, incident response, and compliance.

10. **Develop Incident Response Plans:** Having a well-documented and regularly tested incident response plan helps in quickly detecting and responding to any security incidents.

It's important to remember that detection is just one part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. Prevention, response, and recovery are equally important. The goal is not just to detect threats but also to prevent them where possible, respond effectively when they occur, and recover quickly to minimize downtime and damage.
