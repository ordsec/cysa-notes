# CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-002)

Welcome!

These are my notes that I've been taking while watching the [Certify Breakfast CySA+ video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMYSjEaGLw_vGxGsAIUgmkbEm52QR02tx) on YouTube.

I highly recommend watching that course if you're preparing for the CS0-002 exam - the quality of content and explanation is absolutely top-notch.

The names of files match video titles from the course, but numbers don't match - hopefully this isn't much of a problem.

Additionally, I have been going through the [Wiley/Sybex CySA+ study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-CySA-Study-Guide-CS0-002/dp/1119684056/ref=sr_1_1?crid=4K55D7GLV5X&keywords=wiley+cs0-002&qid=1686671008&s=books&sprefix=wiley+cs0-002%2Cstripbooks%2C272&sr=1-1) and enhancing these notes with some further details.

Please note that the CS0-002 version of the exam is being retired in December 2023, and the CS0-003 version is getting a major update. You can refer to the [CS0-003 exam objectives](https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/comptia-cysa-cs0-003-exam-objectives-2-0.pdf) for further details. There are some structural changes. Updated study guides from Wiley should be available in July 2023.

There's likely some repetition insofar as one concept may be explained in more than one note. I don't see it as a problem as we like redundancy! But I'm also trying to keep things as organized thematically as possible.

### Objectives PDF

I've added the PDF file with official CS0-002 exam objectives from CompTIA. For each objective in each domain, I am adding a mapping to a note that will have definitions and context for each listed term. Sometimes different terms under one objective will be in different notes, sometimes an entire objective will be in one note - it should be pretty easy to tell.

That's all for now - enjoy, and I apologize in advance for any typos :)
